# Introduction
Welcome to my blog! My name is Derek Thomas and I am currently a Pre-Sales Machine Learning Success Engineer at 
[Hugging Face ü§ó](https://huggingface.co)! I'm really proud to work here as it was my dream when I first stumbled upon 
`pytorch-pretrained-bert` way back in November 2018 and was blown away. 

I live in Abu Dhabi, UAE, though I'm not from here. I'm an American from Kentucky. Un-related (possibly) I make 
superb fried chicken üçó. I moved here in 2017 because I quit my job and sold my car, to chase a girl. 
I'd say it worked out, since we got married and have 2 kids.

# Focus
Now that you know a little about me, let me tell you about my intentions here. I want to post about interesting topics
around AI. I've also noticed a gap around Arabic NLP. Arabic is spoken by ~1 Billion people but tends to not have
as much activity as other non-english languages. I don't speak Arabic, but I'll see if there are creative ways to make
valuable posts.

I hope you find these posts valuable! Please don't hesitate to add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dthomas/) or
